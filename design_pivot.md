# Design Pivot: Organic Modernism (Lighter & Warmer)

## Core Philosophy
Moving away from the "Neo-Urban Noir" (dark, aggressive, tech-heavy) to **"Organic Modernism"**.
The goal is to feel **approachable, trustworthy, and sophisticated** without being cold or overly futuristic. Real estate is about *homes* and *people*, not just data.

## Visual Language

### Color Palette
-   **Primary:** **Sage Green** (`oklch(0.65 0.1 150)`) - Represents growth, stability, and calm.
-   **Background:** **Warm Sand / Off-White** (`oklch(0.98 0.01 90)`) - Replaces the harsh black. Soft and inviting.
-   **Secondary/Accent:** **Soft Coral** (`oklch(0.75 0.15 40)`) - For warm, human highlights (buttons, key points).
-   **Text:** **Charcoal** (`oklch(0.25 0.02 260)`) - High contrast but softer than pure black.
-   **Surface:** **White** (`oklch(1 0 0)`) - For cards and sections to pop against the sand background.

### Typography
-   **Headings:** *Playfair Display* (Serif) - Adds a touch of elegance, tradition, and editorial class.
-   **Body:** *Lato* (Sans-serif) - Friendly, round, and highly readable.

### Imagery Style
-   **Lighting:** Natural daylight, "Golden Hour", soft shadows.
-   **Subjects:**
    -   Bright, airy Hong Kong interiors.
    -   Daytime cityscapes with greenery (e.g., view from The Peak).
    -   Real estate agents interacting warmly with clients (handshakes, coffee, discussions).
    -   Abstract elements: Leaves, organic curves, paper textures.

## Content Tone Shift
-   *From:* "Dominate", "Attack", "Neon", "Sequence Initiated"
-   *To:* "Connect", "Grow", "Clarity", "Let's Begin"
-   *Voice:* Professional, supportive, insightful, partner-focused.

## UI Elements
-   **Rounded Corners:** `0.75rem` or `1rem` (softer than the sharp edges).
-   **Shadows:** Soft, diffused shadows (`box-shadow: 0 10px 30px -10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`).
-   **Buttons:** Pill-shaped or rounded rectangles.
